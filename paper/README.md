final submission.

Here is a guide to the provided files (modify those in bold):
* icml2014.bst and icml2014.sty - these are the files necessary to format your
paper in a standardize manner.  Upload these to OverLeaf or your IDE if you prefer to do you work that way.
* examples/ - an example PDF written using the given style file
* **references.bib** - your bibliography
* **paper.tex** - This is the main file for compiling your program; you can add additional TeX files.
* **Makefile** - to easily compile your document, type **make** on the command line.  

**NOTE** if you choose not to use this template, it is up to you to ensure your 
document is well formatted, including citations etc.
