## Introduction

This project was first created as a final project with
[Alex Rimerman](https://github.com/alex-rimerman) for an undergrad Machine
Learning course at Swarthmore College. Now, it is maintained as time allows out
of interest in the subject. The inspiration for the original project came from
the use of technology in modern baseball. Specifically, on the scoreboard at any
professional baseball game, the pitch type is displayed immediately after the
pitch is thrown, far too quick for human entry. So, we wanted to replicate this
process as best as we could (at least for what time allows in a 5 week final
project) by implementing machine learning models to predict pitch type based on
pitch metrics. Currently, the best model works with better than 90% accuracy and
runtime on the order of milliseconds.
